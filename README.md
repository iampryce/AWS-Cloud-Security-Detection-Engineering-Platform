</h1>

<p align="center">

</p>

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a cloud-native security detection platform in AWS using native services such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Lambda, and SNS. The goal is to collect security telemetry, detect suspicious activity, and generate actionable alerts similar to a real SOC environment.


 ## Detection Goals

The purpose of this detection platform is to identify and alert on high-risk security events within the AWS environment. The following detection goals were defined before implementing logging and monitoring controls:

1. Root Account Usage

2. IAM Privilege Escalation

3. Unauthorized API Calls

4. Sensitive Data Access (S3)

5. Known Malicious Activity
