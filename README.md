## Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and implement a cloud-native security detection platform in AWS using native services such as CloudTrail, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Lambda, and SNS. The goal is to collect security telemetry, detect suspicious activity, and generate actionable alerts similar to a real SOC environment.
